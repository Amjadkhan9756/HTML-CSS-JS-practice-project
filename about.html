                I am building this website to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I want to strengthen my foundational skills. By doing this, I hope to gain confidence, master the basics, and grow as a developer.

        <h1>My Study Journey</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Amjad Khan. I am from Bhojipura. I completed my 10th and 12th from Bharat Inter College. After that, I got admission to SRMS CET Bareilly to pursue CSE. My batch is 2022, and currently I am in my second year because I took a gap year due to
            my father’s critical condition — he was paralyzed. Now, I have gained one skill: full stack web development. I am also learning DevOps and working on DSA problems. I want to gain new skills in AI too.
