                I am making this website to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I have low confidence in my basic knowledge of these topics. That’s why I am building this website — to practice the basic concepts, gain confidence, and improve my skills.

            My name is Amjad Khan. I am from Bhojipura. I completed my 10th and 12th from Bharat Inter College. After completing this, I got admission to SRMS CET Bareilly and am pursuing CSE. My batch is 2022, and currently I am in my second year because I took
            a gap year due to my father’s critical condition — he was paralyzed. That’s why I took the gap. Now I have gained one skill: full stack web development. I am also learning DevOps and working on DSA problems, and I want to gain a new skill
            in Generative AI.
